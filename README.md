# Project Proposal: SpotSport NYC

## Project title: SpotSport NYC


## What and Why?

### What
- We propose to build a mobile app that integrates comprehensive information about sports venues in New York City. This app will provide users with detailed information on various sports venues, including location, pricing, size, and other relevant details. Additionally, it will feature user ratings and reviews to offer insights into the quality and experience of each venue. The app will also include a social grouping feature to allow users to find and connect with others interested in similar sports activities or events.

### Why
- The problem this app aims to solve is the difficulty in finding and comparing sports venues in NYC. I am a table tennis player, and I often encounter the problem of finding a table tennis table in the City. I have friends complaining that finding a soccer field or a tennis court in NYC and around areas is difficult since there are too few information accessible. Currently, our targetd users may have to consult multiple sources to gather information about different venues, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient. By consolidating this information into a single app, we simplify the process of choosing a venue and enhance the overall user experience. The addition of user ratings and social features will further help users make informed decisions and connect with others who share their interests.

## For Whom?
This app is designed for sports enthusiasts and individuals looking for sports venues in New York City. This includes:
- Amateur and Professional Athletes: Looking for training or competition venues.
- Sports Teams and Clubs: Needing to book venues for practices or games.
- Event Organizers: Searching for venues to host sports events or tournaments.
- General Public: Individuals interested in finding and attending sports activities or events.
The app will cater to both locals and visitors in NYC, offering them an easy-to-use platform to find and evaluate sports venues.

## How?
From an end-user's perspective, our App will offer
- Venue Discovery: Users can search for sports venues based on location, type of sport, size, and other filters. The app will display a map view and a list view of available venues.
- Venue Details: Each venue listing will include detailed information such as location, pricing, capacity, facilities, and available sports activities. Users can view photos and read descriptions to make informed decisions.
- User Ratings and Reviews: Users can rate and review venues based on their experiences. They can read reviews from other users to gauge the quality of the venue.
- Social Grouping: Users can join or create groups based on their sports interests. This feature will allow users to connect with others, organize events, and share information about sports activities.
- Booking and Scheduling: In cooperation with the business owners, our app offer Users the option to book or reserve sports venues directly through the app (optional feature for future development).

## Scope
The scope of this project is appropriate for a group of 4-6 programmers within a semester. The core features—venue discovery, detailed listings, user ratings, and social grouping—are well-defined and achievable within the given timeframe. The project complexity lies in integrating various data sources, implementing user interaction features, and ensuring a smooth user experience. This scope allows for a manageable yet challenging development process that can be completed within a semester.
