### Project Proposal: NYC Sports Venues App 

##What and Why?
#What
- We propose to build a mobile app that integrates comprehensive information about sports venues in New York City. This app will provide users with detailed information on various sports venues, including location, pricing, size, and other relevant details. Additionally, it will feature user ratings and reviews to offer insights into the quality and experience of each venue. The app will also include a social grouping feature to allow users to find and connect with others interested in similar sports activities or events.

#Why
- The problem this app aims to solve is the difficulty in finding and comparing sports venues in NYC. I am a table tennis player, and I often encounter the problem of finding a table tennis table in the City. I have friends complaining that finding a soccer field or a tennis court in NYC and around areas is difficult since there are too few information accessible. Currently, our targetd users may have to consult multiple sources to gather information about different venues, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient. By consolidating this information into a single app, we simplify the process of choosing a venue and enhance the overall user experience. The addition of user ratings and social features will further help users make informed decisions and connect with others who share their interests.
